Reversed aiml is part of the Charlix Project

http://charlix.sourceforge.net/reversedaiml.html

Largely inspired by a tutorial by Gary Dubuque:
Dynamically Learning AIML http://209.168.21.76/AIMLpad/Learning.htm

Completely new aiml files. For a plain english sentence, 
a bunch of probable questions will be printed in the answers.  

This is a simplified version of reversedaiml which is ready to run on pandorabot.com.

For a full version of reversedAiml get the latest version of the main branch.

ra-quest.aiml.dev can be used instead of ra-learn-quest.aiml if you want the aiml categories to be shown if you rename it properly and remove ra-learn-quest.aiml.
